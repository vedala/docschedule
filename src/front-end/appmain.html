<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The DocSchedule application can be used to generate
schedule for hospitalist physician groups.
A hospitalist physician group usually provides 24x7x365 care
to admitted patients at a hospital.</p>

<h3>A Basic Scenario</h3>

<p>Following scenario will help understand the application better:</p>

<ul>
<li>The hospitalist group consists of eight physicians.</li>
<li>The group is divided into two teams of four physcians
  each (Let's call the teams Team-A and Team-B).</li>
<li>Each team works 7 days straight starting on a Tuesday. During
  the 7 days that Team-A is working, Team-B does not work and
  vice-versa.</li>
<li>For example, Team-A works from 6-July-2015 to 13-July-2015. Then,
  Team-B works from 14-July-2015 to 20-July-2015. And so on.</li>
<li>On any given day, four physicians work at the hospital,
  three on Day shift and one on Night shift.</li>
<li>Day shift is 7am to 7pm. Night shift is 7pm to 7am.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Features in the Current Version</h3>
<ul>
<li>The application is currently in early stages of development, so very
  basic functionality is available.</li>
<li>Upon login, schedule for 6 weeks is displayed (starting from current week).</li>
<li>Schedule page can be accessed only by authenticated users.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Planned Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ability to scroll schedule forward and backward, so user can view
more than six weeks' worth of schedule.</li>
<li>Ability to generate schedule. This feature will enable group director
  to create schedule for a period of time (usually a few months) based
  or pre-set rules. The pre-set rules are similar to rules described in
  the Basic Scenario above. This feature will be authorized only for
  the director.</li>
<li>Ability to modify rules. Provide interface to enable the director
  to modify rules. This feature only authorized for the director.</li>
<li>Add SSL support.</li>
<li>Ability to Sign-Up users from website.</li>
<li>Enhance application to support multiple tenants.</li>
</ul>
  
<h3>Technical Note</h3>
<ul>
<li>The application is developed using Java, Apache Tomcat, MySQL.</li>
<li>Apache Shiro is used for user authentication.</li>
<li>Front-end is written mainly in basic HTML, CSS and JSP.</li>
<li>jQuery is the only front-end library used.</li>
<li>Data is fetched from the back-end via a call to REST web service.
  This service is developed in Java using Jersey REST library and
  Jackson library for JSON conversion.</li>
<li>Front-end uses Ajax to make a call to the web service and schedule
  display is generated using JavaScript.</li>
</ul>
